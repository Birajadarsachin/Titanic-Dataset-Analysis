Titanic Dataset Analysis and Visualization
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset using Python. The project involves data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis to gain insights into survival rates, demographic patterns, and relationships between various features of the passengers.

**Project Overview**

In this project, we perform the following tasks:

Data Loading & Cleaning: Importing the dataset, handling missing values, and removing duplicate rows.

Feature Engineering: Extracting useful features, such as passenger titles (e.g., Mr., Mrs.), and calculating family sizes.

Data Visualization: Visualizing the distribution of variables like age, fare, survival rates, and demographics using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Statistical Analysis: Analyzing the correlation between numerical variables and survival rates, as well as calculating the central tendency (mean, median, mode) and spread (standard deviation, interquartile range).

Survival Analysis: Investigating survival rates based on sex, passenger class, and other features.

**Libraries Used**
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib: For creating visualizations.
Seaborn: For advanced data visualization and statistical plotting.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning utilities (optional if building models).



**Project Insights**

1. Demographic Distribution:
Visualized the distribution of passengers' ages, fares, and survival status.
Explored survival rates based on passenger sex and class.

3. Correlation Analysis:
Computed and visualized the correlation between numerical variables, identifying key relationships (e.g., Fare and Pclass).

5. Survival Analysis:
Survival rates were analyzed based on passenger class, sex, and other demographic factors.
The project uncovered insights like how the survival rate was higher for women and 1st-class passengers.
